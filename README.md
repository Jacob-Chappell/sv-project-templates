# SystemVerilog Project Templates
Templates that I use for SystemVerilog projects.

The SystemVerilog Module templates are written with envsubst, and are stored in the templates directory. The Makefile has variables ORGANIZATION and PROJECT_NAME which should be set before use.

# Requirements

- Verilator 5.0.10 or higher

- FuseSoC 2.2.1 or higher

- envsubst

# Future Work

Add the ability to use more than just verilator for source sims.

Add in a gate level simulation option.
